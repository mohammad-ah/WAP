1.	Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it): 

x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
var x = 10;
document.write(x); //10
document.write(a); //8
var f = function(a, b, c) {
b = a;
document.write(b); //8
b = c;
var x = 5;
}
f(a,b,c);
document.write(b); //9
}
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b); //10
document.write(x); //1
}

2.	What is the difference between a method and function?

- Method is a function when object is associated with it. When no object is associated with it, it comes to function.



3.	What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?

- The current object.



4.	What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?

- The object which is executing the current peace of Javascript code.


5.	What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?

- The object that "owns" the code of the constructor.



6.	Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

- The specific object that called it originally. It binds to whatever object that calls the function.



7.	What is a free variable in JavaScript?

- It’s a variable in a parent function, which means it’s not declared in the current function nor passed to it as a parameter. However, the current function can still access it.



8.	Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.

-
 var obj = {
	name: “fred”,
	major: “music”,
	fun: function (x, y){
		if (x === y)
			return x * y;
		else if (x < y)
			return x;
		else
			return y;
}
}



9.	Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

- Employee = function (name, salary, position) {
	this.name = name;
	this.salary = salary;
	this.position = position;
}
Var obj = new Employee (‘Dalia’, 1000, ‘CRM Developer’);



10.	Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the arguments.

-
function blah () {
	var product = “”;
	for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length ; ++i) 
		product += arguments[i];
}



11.	Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.

-
function findMax() {
var max = -Infinity;
for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
if (arguments[i] > max) 
      			max = arguments[i];
  	}
return max;
}
