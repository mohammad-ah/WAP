1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?

$ is a function that can be called - $().

The behaviour of $() varies immensely depending on the parameters supplied, although all examples below will return a jQuery object. It can:

register a document.ready handler - $(myfunc)
act as a selector - $('#myid')
construct elements - $('<div>')
return an empty object - $()
$ is also an object that contains various utility functions $.each, etc as properties of that object. In this context, it acts like a namespace for those functions.



2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background
color red.
Sample HTML:
<body>
<h1>abc</h1><br><div>
 <h1>div-1</h1>
 <h1>div-2</h1>
 </div>
 <h1>xyz</h1>
</body>


$("div h1").css("background-color", "red");


3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
<!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
</script>
</head>
<body>
<p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
</body>
</html>

$("p").append("YES!");
