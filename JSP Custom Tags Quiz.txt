1.	Rewrite the JSP page in the first demo (forEach) to use scripting instead of the JSTL forEach.
<html>
	<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">
	<title>Lecture 5</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	<table>
	for(Student s : students) { %>
	<tr>
	<td><%= s.getName(); %></td>
	<td><%= s.getAge(); %><//td>
	</tr>
	<% } %>
	</table>
	</body>
</html>


2.	How do custom tags relate to JSTL?
JSTL is a collection of useful JSP custom tags which encapsulates the core functionality common to many JSP applications


3.	What is the role of the URI in the TLD and the taglib directive?
The URI in the taglib directive is a pointer to the TLD file.


4.	What is a tag handler class?
When a JSP page containing a custom tag is translated into a servlet, the tag is converted to operations on an object called a tag handler.
The Web container then invokes those operations when the JSP page's servlet is executed.



5.	What is the role of attribute setters in a tag handler class?
To create attributes of the created tag.


6.	What is the role of the doTag() method in a tag handler class?
It’s the first method that container calls when the JSP invokes the tag of the tag handler using the name in the TLD.


7.	What does the operation getJspContext().getOut().write(“Hi Bob”) do when called in a doTag() method?
It will print “Hi Bob” when the tag of the doTag() handler is invoked.



8.	What does the operation getJspBody().invoke(null) do when called in a doTag() method?
It outputs the body content of the tag.
