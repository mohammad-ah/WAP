1.	What is the difference between the following 2 statements? 
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

- The first will set the 1st parameter of the setTimeOut with booyah which is a variable that returns a function that will be executed it after 2 seconds. 
The second one will call the function first and if it returns a function, the returned function will be executed in 2 seconds.


2.	What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);
alert(y(2,3));

- They will both display 6.


3.	Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

-
var booyah1 = function() { alert(“BOOYAH!”); }
function booyah2() { return function() { alert(“BOOYAH!”); } }


4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
-Unobtrusive JavaScript is a best practice methodology for attaching JavaScript to the front-end of a website, it means the separation of content and behavior. HTML and Javascript should be separate. Javascript will communicate with the DOM objects to access HTML elements. 
Event handlers should be to the elements from inside the Javascript code.
